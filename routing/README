---- Provelo Bern Operation Guide ----


1. Importing SRTM (done once)
./import_srtm.sh


2. Downloading updated OSM data and prepare directory
./download_osm_and_prepare.sh

3. go into the directory with the current date

4. Importing OSM data (from a date directory)
../import_osm.sh

5. stop networks until only 2 are running.
There is not enough RAM memory; we must free some memory to avoid a
'bad alloc' exception. F.e. by stopping the quiet and upstream networks:
sudo /etc/init.d/osrm-quiet stop
sudo /etc/init.d/osrm-upstream stop

6. Generating OSRM networks (from a date directory)
../generate_new_network.sh

7. start the stopped networks
sudo /etc/init.d/osrm-quiet start
(and check that the others are started as well:
sudo /etc/init.d/osrm-ebike start
sudo /etc/init.d/osrm-fast start
)
